        <p>✯ Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,
            <br>object-oriented, and designed
            <br>to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
        <p>✯ Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any
            <br>Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.</p>
        <p>✯ The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level
            <br>facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
            <br>programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for
            <br>client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>
