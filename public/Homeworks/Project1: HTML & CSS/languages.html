    <p>✯ It can be hard to gauge which programming language to learn
    <br>— should you go for the most widely used language, the language
     <br>   developers enjoy using, or maybe the highest paid language?</p>

    <p>✯ There's no one right answer, but luckily there are no shortage of
        <br>top programming languages lists ranking languages according to
        <br>different criteria.</p>

    <p>✯ The latest is the The Top Programming Languages 2019 list from
        <br>IEEE Spectrum, the magazine for the world's largest professional
        <br>organization devoted to engineering and the applied sciences.</p>

    <p>✯ The ranking is based on a broader range of sources than is typical
        <br>for such lists and weighted towards the needs of IEEE members.</p>

    <p>✯ As such the list is rather different than many others, which tend to
        <br>rely more heavily on measures of popularity such as number of
        <br>GitHub repositories or number of Stack Overflow questions asked.</p>

    <p>✯ In the number one spot is Python followed by Java, C, and C++.
